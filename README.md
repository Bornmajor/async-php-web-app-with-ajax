## Async PHP Application with AJAX
# Description
This PHP application serves as a practical demonstration of asynchronous programming in PHP, showcasing the construction of non-blocking applications using AJAX technology.

# Asynchronous PHP vs Normal PHP Code
Traditional PHP applications operate in a synchronous, or blocking, manner. This means that each operation must complete before the next one begins. On the other hand, asynchronous PHP allows multiple tasks to be executed concurrently, significantly improving performance and responsiveness.

# AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML)
AJAX is a set of web development techniques that enables asynchronous communication between the client and server. It stands for Asynchronous JavaScript and XML, although modern implementations often use JSON instead of XML. AJAX facilitates dynamic, seamless updates to web pages by allowing data to be retrieved from the server without requiring a full page reload.
